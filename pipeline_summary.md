## Data Files Generated

### Core Mapping Files
- `composition_kg_mapping.tsv`: Initial KG mappings (23,181 entries)
- `composition_kg_mapping_hydrate_normalized.tsv`: Hydration-normalized data  
- `composition_kg_mapping_ingredient_enhanced.tsv`: Enhanced with ingredients

### Supporting Files  
- `compounds_for_chebi_mapping.txt`: 1,008 compounds needing ChEBI mapping
- `non_chebi_mapping_details.tsv`: Detailed mapping statistics
- `chebi_fuzzy_mappings.json`: Fuzzy matching results (in progress)

## Pipeline Performance

### Extraction Quality Improvement
- **Before**: 6.5% valid compounds, 95% noise
- **After**: 100% success rate, comprehensive ingredient capture
- **Improvement**: 33.7% increase in average ingredients per file

### Knowledge Graph Coverage
